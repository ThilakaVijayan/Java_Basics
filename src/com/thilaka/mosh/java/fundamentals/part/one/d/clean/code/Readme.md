If your code had more than 10 or 15 lines of code, consider breaking them down.
These small chunks of code are easier to read and understand. A
lso, we can potentially resume them in other programs.
Such code are easier to extend.

### Look for these things while refactoring your code:
1. Lines of code with same concept always go together.
2. Repetitive pattern in your code.
